                <p>This thesis serves to give a mathematical overview of topological quantum computation
                    and to apply the theory to characterize desirable fault-tolerant operations called protected
                    gates. Topological quantum computation is a novel paradigm for quantum computation which
                    seeks to harness certain exotic quantum systems known as topological phases of matter that
                    exhibit unique physical phenomena such as the manifestation of quasiparticle excitations called
                    anyons. The low energy effective field theories of these systems can be expressed by certain
                    topological quantum field theories, which in turn are described in terms of unitary modular
                    tensor categories that capture the essential properties of a topological phase of matter and its
                    corresponding anyon model. An overview of the relevant category theoretic concepts is given,
                    and the axioms of a unitary modular tensor category are made explicit. A topological quantum
                    field theory is then defined and used to describe topological quantum computation. Having
                    developed the necessary theoretical background, the theory is then applied to characterize
                    protected gates. The main result is a no-go theorem which states that, for any model, the set
                    of protected gates is finite, and hence, cannot be used to do universal quantum computation
                    using protected gates alone.
